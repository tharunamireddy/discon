			<h2 style="color: #f63a53;">Review System for International Conference DISC2024</h2>
			<p>This upcoming international conference DISC 2024 will adopt a double-blind review system. This procedure is designed to uphold the quality of submissions and provide an equitable platform for all contributors, irrespective of their reputation or affiliations.</p>
			
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			
			<p><strong>Overview of the Double-Blind Review System</strong></p>
			
			<p>The double-blind review system is a peer review method where both the identities of the authors and the reviewers are concealed from each other. This approach aims to eliminate any potential biases based on the author&#39;s background, institutional affiliation, or previous work, fostering a more impartial and objective evaluation process.</p>
			
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			
			<p><strong>Submission Process</strong></p>
			
			<p>Authors will be required to prepare their manuscripts in a way that preserves anonymity. Key guidelines include:</p>
			
			<p>1. Title Page: The title page should be submitted separately and must include the title of the paper, author names, affiliations, and contact information.</p>
			
			<p>2. Main Manuscript: The main document should not contain any identifying information, such as author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or any references that could reveal the author&rsquo;s identity.</p>
			
			<p>3. Self-Citations: Authors must ensure that citations to their own work are written in the third person, so as not to reveal their identity indirectly.</p>
			
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			
			<p><strong>Reviewer Selection and Assignment</strong></p>
			
			<p>Reviewers will be selected based on their expertise in the relevant field to ensure a competent and thorough evaluation of each submission. Reviewers will receive the anonymized manuscripts, allowing them to focus solely on the quality and content of the research without any preconceived notions about the authors.</p>
			
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			
			<p><strong>Review Process</strong></p>
			
			<p>1. Initial Check: The conference committee will conduct an initial check to ensure that all submissions comply with the anonymity requirements. Papers failing to meet these standards will be returned to authors for correction.</p>
			
			<p>2. Assignment: Each paper will be assigned to a set of reviewers with expertise in the corresponding subject area. Reviewers will be unaware of the authors&rsquo; identities, and vice versa.</p>
			
			<p>3. Evaluation Criteria: Reviewers will assess the manuscripts based on predefined criteria such as originality, significance, methodology, clarity, and contribution to the field. Constructive feedback will be provided to help authors improve their work.</p>
			
			<p>4. Decision Making: Based on the reviewers&rsquo; reports, the conference committee will make decisions regarding acceptance, revision, or rejection of the submissions. The final decision will be communicated to the authors while maintaining confidentiality.</p>
			
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			
			<p><strong>Ensuring Integrity and Fairness</strong></p>
			
			<p>To further ensure the integrity of the double-blind review process, the following measures will be implemented:</p>
			
			<p>1. Conflict of Interest Disclosure: Reviewers will be required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest with the assigned papers to avoid biased evaluations.</p>
			
			<p>2. Ethical Compliance: Both authors and reviewers will be reminded of the ethical standards and the importance of adhering to the double-blind review process.</p>
